  <h2>✍️ History of Drawing – From Caves to Creativity</h2>
 <h4>🪨Prehistoric Era (30,000–10,000 BCE)</h4> 
<h5>The earliest drawings are found on cave walls in places like Lascaux (France) and Altamira (Spain).</h5>

<h5>These drawings, made with charcoal and natural pigments, depicted animals, humans, and hunting scenes.</h5>

<h5>Drawing was used for communication, rituals, and storytelling before writing existed.</h5>

<h4>🏛️ Ancient Civilizations</h4>
<h5>In Egypt, drawings were used in hieroglyphs and tomb paintings to tell stories of gods and pharaohs.</h5>

<h5>In Greece and Rome, drawing helped develop proportions and anatomy. Artists used it to plan sculptures and architecture.</h5>

<h4>✝️ Medieval Period (5th–15th Century)</h4>
<h5>Art was mostly religious—drawings served as illustrations in manuscripts and stained-glass designs.</h5>

<h5>Artists used ink, gold leaf, and natural dyes in their works.</h5>

<h4>

🎨 Renaissance (14th–17th Century) – The Golden Age</h4>
<h5>Drawing became a respected art form and foundational skill.

Masters like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael used drawing to explore science, anatomy, and architecture.
</h5>
<h5>Paper became more accessible, and sketchbooks were used.</h5>

<h4>🖌️ 17th–19th Century</h4>
<h5>Drawing evolved with styles like Baroque, Romanticism, and Realism.</h5>

<h5>Artists used it for both preliminary sketches and as finished artworks.

Tools expanded: charcoal, graphite, pen & ink, pastels.</h5>
 
<h4>🖥️ 20th Century to Now</h4>
<h5>Modernism brought abstract and expressive styles (think Picasso, Kandinsky, Matisse).</h5>

<h5>Today, drawing includes digital art, animation, and 3D design.

Still used in fashion design, architecture, game design, and fine art.</h5>
