  <p>Drawing is a form of visual art that involves making marks on a surface using tools like pencils, pens, charcoal, or digital styluses. It is one of the oldest and most universal ways humans express themselves, tell stories, and share ideas. From simple sketches to detailed illustrations, drawing can capture anything—from real-life scenes to imagination.</p>

<p>Artists use drawing to study shapes, plan larger artworks, or create finished pieces. It can be realistic or abstract, quick or detailed, playful or serious. Today, drawing is found everywhere—from animation and comics to engineering, fashion design, and digital art.</p>

<p>Whether you're a beginner or a professional, drawing is a powerful tool to observe, create, and communicate.</p>
